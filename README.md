# Beyond Fine-Tuning and Retrieval: Why RAG and SFT Don’t Solve Math

This is the repo for the EECS 595 final project in Fall 2025. Some files display as "invalid notebook" but the codes are working. 

- RAG_final.ipynb: The RAG implementation on SFT model
- ./Aliyun/sft: datasets, data processing and model evaluation (model itself is not included due to space limit)
- base_model_to_Ali.ipynb: Turn MATH into JSONL format
- convert_math_dataset_to_json.py: Include info about levels and type in JSON for MATH
- *.jsonl and *.json: Processed datasets in different formats
