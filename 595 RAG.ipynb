       " 'content': 'In mathematics, the derivative is a fundamental tool that quantifies the sensitivity to change of a function\\'s output with respect to its input. The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value. The derivative is often described as the instantaneous rate of change, the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable to that of the independent variable. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation.\\nThere are multiple different notations for differentiation. Leibniz notation, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, is represented as the ratio of two differentials, whereas prime notation is written by adding a prime mark. Higher order notations represent repeated differentiation, and they are usually denoted in Leibniz notation by adding superscripts to the differentials, and in prime notation by adding additional prime marks. Higher order derivatives are used in physics; for example, the first derivative  with respect to time of the position of a moving object is its velocity, and the second derivative is its acceleration.\\nDerivatives can be generalized to functions of several real variables. In this case, the derivative is reinterpreted as a linear transformation whose graph is (after an appropriate translation) the best linear approximation to the graph of the original function. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix that represents this linear transformation with respect to the basis given by the choice of independent and dependent variables.  It can be calculated in terms of the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables.  For a real-valued function of several variables, the Jacobian matrix reduces to the gradient vector.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\n\\n\\n=== As a limit ===\\nA function of a real variable \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(x)}\\n  \\n is differentiable at a point \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n  \\n of its domain, if its domain contains an open interval containing \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n  \\n\\u2060, and the limit\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        L\\n        =\\n        \\n          lim\\n          \\n            h\\n            →\\n            0\\n          \\n        \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              f\\n              (\\n              a\\n              +\\n              h\\n              )\\n              −\\n              f\\n              (\\n              a\\n              )\\n            \\n            h\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle L=\\\\lim _{h\\\\to 0}{\\\\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}}\\n  \\n\\nexists.

In other words, the derivative is the slope of the tangent.\\n\\n\\n=== Using infinitesimals ===\\nOne way to think of the derivative \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              d\\n              f\\n            \\n            \\n              d\\n              x\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n        (\\n        a\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\textstyle {\\\\frac {df}{dx}}(a)}\\n  \\n is as the ratio of an infinitesimal change in the output of the function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n  \\n to an infinitesimal change in its input. In order to make this intuition rigorous, a system of rules for manipulating infinitesimal quantities is required. The system of hyperreal numbers is a way of treating infinite and infinitesimal quantities.  The hyperreals are an extension of the real numbers that contain numbers greater than anything of the form \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        1\\n        +\\n        1\\n        +\\n        ⋯\\n        +\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 1+1+\\\\cdots +1}\\n  \\n for any finite number of terms. Such numbers are infinite, and their reciprocals are infinitesimals. The application of hyperreal numbers to the foundations of calculus is called nonstandard analysis. This provides a way to define the basic concepts of calculus such as the derivative and integral in terms of infinitesimals, thereby giving a precise meaning to the \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        d\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle d}\\n  \\n in the Leibniz notation.

If \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h}\\n  \\n is positive, then \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        +\\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a+h}\\n  \\n is on the high part of the step, so the secant line from \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a}\\n  \\n to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        a\\n        +\\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle a+h}\\n  \\n has slope zero. Consequently, the secant lines do not approach any single slope, so the limit of the difference quotient does not exist. However, even if a function is continuous at a point, it may not be differentiable there. For example, the absolute value function given by \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          |\\n        \\n        x\\n        \\n          |\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(x)=|x|}\\n  \\n is continuous at \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        =\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x=0}\\n  \\n\\u2060, but it is not differentiable there. If \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h}\\n  \\n is positive, then the slope of the secant line from 0 to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h}\\n  \\n is one; if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h}\\n  \\n is negative, then the slope of the secant line from \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle 0}\\n  \\n to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        h\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle h}\\n  \\n is \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        −\\n        1\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle -1}\\n  \\n\\u2060.  This can be seen graphically as a \"kink\" or a \"cusp\" in the graph at \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        =\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x=0}\\n  \\n. Even a function with a smooth graph is not differentiable at a point where its tangent is vertical: For instance, the function given by \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n        =\\n        \\n          x\\n          \\n            1\\n            \\n              /\\n            \\n            3\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(x)=x^{1/3}}\\n  \\n is not differentiable at \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        =\\n        0\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x=0}\\n  \\n. In summary, a function that has a derivative is continuous, but there are continuous functions that do not have a derivative.\\nMost functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or almost every point. Early in the history of calculus, many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. Under mild conditions (for example, if the function is a monotone or a Lipschitz function), this is true. However, in 1872, Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  This example is now known as the Weierstrass function. In 1931, Stefan Banach proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a meager set in the space of all continuous functions. Informally, this means that hardly any random continuous functions have a derivative at even one point.\\n\\n\\n== Notation ==\\n\\nOne common way of writing the derivative of a function is Leibniz notation, introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675, which denotes a derivative as the quotient of two differentials, such as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        d\\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle dy}\\n  \\n and \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        d\\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle dx}\\n  \\n\\u2060. It is still commonly used when the equation \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n        =\\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y=f(x)}\\n  \\n is viewed as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables. The first derivative is denoted by \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            \\n              \\n                d\\n                y\\n              \\n              \\n                d\\n                x\\n              \\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle {\\\\frac {dy}{dx}}}\\n  \\n\\u2060, read as \"the derivative of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle y}\\n  \\n with respect to \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n\\u2060\".

For denoting the number of higher derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in superscript, whereas others place the number in parentheses, such as \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            \\n              i\\n              v\\n            \\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f^{\\\\mathrm {iv} }}\\n  \\n or \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          f\\n          \\n            (\\n            4\\n            )\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f^{(4)}}\\n  \\n\\u2060.

This notation is used exclusively for derivatives with respect to time or arc length. It is typically used in differential equations in physics and differential geometry.

Antiderivatives are not unique: if \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        A\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A}\\n  \\n is an antiderivative of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n  \\n, then so is \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        A\\n        +\\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle A+c}\\n  \\n, where \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        c\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle c}\\n  \\n is any constant, because the derivative of a constant is zero. The fundamental theorem of calculus shows that finding an antiderivative of a function gives a way to compute the areas of shapes bounded by that function. More precisely, the integral of a function over a closed interval is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of that interval.\\n\\n\\n== Higher-order derivatives ==\\nHigher order derivatives are the result of differentiating a function repeatedly. Given that \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n  \\n is a differentiable function, the derivative of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f}\\n  \\n is the first derivative, denoted as \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          f\\n          ′\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f\\'}\\n  \\n\\u2060.

A function that has \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  \\n successive derivatives is called \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  \\n times differentiable. If the \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        k\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle k}\\n  \\n-th derivative is continuous, then the function is said to be of differentiability class \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          C\\n          \\n            k\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle C^{k}}\\n  \\n\\u2060. A function that has infinitely many derivatives is called infinitely differentiable or smooth. Any polynomial function is infinitely differentiable; taking derivatives repeatedly will eventually result in a constant function, and all subsequent derivatives of that function are zero.\\nOne application of higher-order derivatives is in physics. Suppose that a function represents the position of an object at the time. The first derivative of that function is the velocity of an object with respect to time, the second derivative of the function is the acceleration of an object with respect to time, and the third derivative is the jerk.\\n\\n\\n== In other dimensions ==\\n\\n\\n=== Vector-valued functions ===\\nA vector-valued function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          y\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {y} }\\n  \\n of a real variable sends real numbers to vectors in some vector space \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            R\\n          \\n          \\n            n\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\\n  \\n.

A partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant. Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry. As with ordinary derivatives, multiple notations exist: the partial derivative of a function \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        ,\\n        y\\n        ,\\n        …\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(x,y,\\\\dots )}\\n  \\n with respect to the variable \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n is variously denoted by\\n\\namong other possibilities.

The common thread is that the derivative of a function at a point serves as a linear approximation of the function at that point.\\n\\nAn important generalization of the derivative concerns complex functions of complex variables, such as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          C\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {C} }\\n  \\n to \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          C\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {C} }\\n  \\n\\u2060. The notion of the derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          C\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {C} }\\n  \\n is identified with \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            R\\n          \\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{2}}\\n  \\n by writing a complex number \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        z\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle z}\\n  \\n as \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n        +\\n        i\\n        y\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x+iy}\\n  \\n\\u2060 then a differentiable function from \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          C\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {C} }\\n  \\n to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          C\\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {C} }\\n  \\n is certainly differentiable as a function from \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            R\\n          \\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{2}}\\n  \\n to \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            R\\n          \\n          \\n            2\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{2}}\\n  \\n (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.\\nAnother generalization concerns functions between differentiable or smooth manifolds. Intuitively speaking such a manifold \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        M\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle M}\\n  \\n is a space that can be approximated near each point \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n by a vector space called its tangent space: the prototypical example is a smooth surface in \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        \\n          \\n            R\\n          \\n          \\n            3\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbb {R} ^{3}}\\n  \\n\\u2060. The derivative (or differential) of a (differentiable) map \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        :\\n        M\\n        →\\n        N\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f:M\\\\to N}\\n  \\n between manifolds, at a point \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n in \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        M\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle M}\\n  \\n\\u2060, is then a linear map from the tangent space of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        M\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle M}\\n  \\n at \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        x\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle x}\\n  \\n to the tangent space of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        N\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle N}\\n  \\n at \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        f\\n        (\\n        x\\n        )\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle f(x)}\\n  \\n\\u2060. The derivative function becomes a map between the tangent bundles of \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        M\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle M}\\n  \\n and \\u2060\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        N\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle N}\\n  \\n\\u2060. This definition is used in differential geometry.\\nDifferentiation can also be defined for maps between vector space, such as Banach space, in which those generalizations are the Gateaux derivative and the Fréchet derivative.\\nOne deficiency of the classical derivative is that very many functions are not differentiable. Nevertheless, there is a way of extending the notion of the derivative so that all continuous functions and many other functions can be differentiated using a concept known as the weak derivative. The idea is to embed the continuous functions in a larger space called the space of distributions and only require that a function is differentiable \"on average\".\\nProperties of the derivative have inspired the introduction and study of many similar objects in algebra and topology; an example is differential algebra. Here, it consists of the derivation of some topics in abstract algebra, such as rings, ideals, field, and so on.\\nThe discrete equivalent of differentiation is finite differences. The study of differential calculus is unified with the calculus of finite differences in time scale calculus.\\nThe arithmetic derivative involves the function that is defined for the integers by the prime factorization. This is an analogy with the product rule.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCovariant derivative\\nDerivation\\nExterior derivative\\nFunctional derivative\\nLie derivative \\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\n\"Derivative\", Encyclopedia of Mathematics, EMS Press, 2001 [1994]\\nKhan Academy: \"Newton, Leibniz, and Usain Bolt\"\\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Derivative\".
